Some of the most popular programming languages are the C-like ones.
They include C, C++, C#, Java, PHP, Python, Objective-C etc.
Almost all of them are widely used nowadays for different purposes.
For example, until Swift was introduced in 2014, Objective-C was the main
programming language used by Apple for the OS X and iOS operating systems.
In turn, Java is considered to be the best choice for very big projects,
in which many programmers are involved.
PHP can include HTML, so it is very popular among the front-enders.
C is very fast, due to its low level, so it's primarily used for drivers
and OSs.
C++ is mainly used in the game development sector.
