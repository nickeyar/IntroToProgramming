Written mostly in Java, Eclipse can be used to develop applications.
By means of various plug-ins, Eclipse may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages:
Ada, ABAP, C, C++, COBOL, Fortran, Haskell, JavaScript, Lasso, Natural, Perl, PHP, Prolog, Python, R,
Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), Scala, Clojure, Groovy, Scheme, and Erlang.
Development environments include the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT) for Java and Scala, Eclipse CDT for C/C++ and Eclipse PDT for PHP, etc.
4. NetBeans
NetBeans is an IDE for developing primarily with Java, but also with other languages,
in particular PHP, C/C++, and HTML5. It is also an application platform framework for Java desktop applications and others.
The NetBeans IDE is written in Java and can run on Windows, OS X, Linux, Solaris and other platforms supporting a compatible JVM.
5. Code::Blocks
